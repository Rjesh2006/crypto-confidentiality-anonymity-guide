# Privacy & Anonymity in Cryptocurrency — A Concise Guide

This repository explains key technologies that protect **confidentiality** (hiding transaction details) and **anonymity** (hiding identities), along with the real-world methods governments use to investigate or deanonymize blockchain activity.

# Security Concepts Guide

## 🔑 Core Security Concepts

* **Confidentiality** – Ensures that information is only accessible to authorized parties, preventing unauthorized disclosure.
* **Integrity** – Protects data from unauthorized modification, ensuring it remains accurate and trustworthy.
* **Availability** – Guarantees that systems and data are accessible to legitimate users when needed.
* **Authentication** – Confirms the identity of a user, system, or entity before granting access.
* **Authorization** – Determines the level of access and privileges granted to authenticated users.
* **Non-repudiation** – Prevents denial of actions by providing verifiable proof, often using digital signatures.
* **Anonymity** – Ensures user identity is hidden, protecting privacy in communications.

## 🛠 Cryptography & Encryption

* **Encryption** – Converts plaintext into ciphertext to protect sensitive information during storage or transfer.
* **Decryption** – Converts ciphertext back into readable plaintext using a secret key.
* **Symmetric Encryption** – Uses a single shared key for both encryption and decryption (e.g., AES).
* **Asymmetric Encryption** – Uses a public-private key pair for secure communication (e.g., RSA).
* **Hashing** – Converts data into a fixed-size digest, ensuring integrity and verification.

## 🔏 Digital Security Mechanisms

* **Digital Signatures** – Provide authenticity and integrity of messages using cryptographic algorithms.
* **Group Signatures** – Allow a member of a group to sign on behalf of the group, preserving anonymity.
* **Ring Signatures** – Enable a signer to sign a message anonymously among a group of users.
* **Blind Signatures** – Hide message content during signing, often used in e-voting or digital cash.
* **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** – Allow one party to prove knowledge of a secret without revealing it.

## 🖥 Trusted Computing

* **Trusted Platform Module (TPM)** – A hardware chip that securely stores cryptographic keys, ensuring system integrity.
* **Secure Boot** – Verifies the integrity of the system boot process to prevent tampering.
* **Hardware Security Module (HSM)** – Dedicated hardware for managing cryptographic operations securely.
